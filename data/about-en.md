# Hi, this is Silence

- Although sounds girly, "Silence" is actually a miniature of a part from my treasured memory (in fact myself and my Chinese name are both very masculine lol)
- Interested in **Privacy** and **Security** for a long time, hope can pursue in these areas after graduation
- Love to explore all kind of **new things**, leading to a vast range of hobbies but not many specialized areas T_T
- Kind of a joke-aholic in daily life (maybe not that much in English?), but often nervous when speaking in front of public 

### When going to school...

- Currently study in **M.S. in Privacy Engineering @ Carnegie Mellon University**
  - "Sleep, Study, Social activities", which two you wanna choose?...
  - But be able to go deep in the area you interested in is bittersweet
- Got my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science and Engineering @ Southeast University, China**
  - The only advantage of Jiulonghu campus is the desolateness
  - Was the chief in front-end development at Herald Studio, where is the beginning of getting screwed up by front-end development
  - Was the Vice President of Network Security Union, won the 5th place in X'NUCA 2017 with fantastic teammates
- Complete both high school and middle school in **The Middle School Attached to Northwestern Polytechnical University, China**
  - Most precious memory in my life, also the peak of my student career (3rd high school in China XD)
  - Was the associate admin of school's forum, produced 20+ articles about local gourmet around the school

### When going to work

- Intern at **Tencent, China** as **Web front-end developer** for 3 mos in 2018
  - Impeccable internship except the 10am-10pm work time
  - Used koa to independently design and develop the general authorization middleware for all online services in MIG
  - Made tons of friends with all the nice colleagues

### When going to enjoy the spare time

- **Basketball** Never Stops, big fan of Kobe Bryant
- Great fan of **Jay Chou** and **Guns n' Roses**. Pop, rock 'n' roll, heavy metal and EDM are all my favorite
- Was a skilled **drummer** (maybe more than 5 yrs ago). A dabbler in  guitar
- Was a platinum Vayne player in **League of Legends**, also a platinum player of Pharah, Mercy and Widowmaker in **Overwatch** (But finally fall in love with **Call of Duty**) 
- **Sleeping in** and **eating meat** are the greatest pursuits
- Like to create some **interesting dishes** when extremely idle
